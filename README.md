# KNOVAK-Home_Sales-Challenge-22

### Hello and Thank You for reviewing my SparkSQL Challenge 22!


## In order to review my code for this assignment, please locate the file labeled Home_Sales_Collab_KNOVAK.ipynb. There you will also find the results to the answers to questions related to this task, which include:

#    - What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

#    - What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

#    - What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

#    - What is the average price of a home per "view" rating having an average home price greater than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query, and round off your answer to two decimal places.


## I used Google Collab in running of the code and found that to be the easiest method. However, if you wish to try it on vs code I have added the initial .ipynb files for vs code and collab within the folders labeled Initial IPYNB and House Sales IPYNBs.

## Please reach out should you have any questions and thank you again for reviewing my work!

## Cheers,
## - Kyle
